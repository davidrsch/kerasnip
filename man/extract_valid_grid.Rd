\title{Extract Valid Grid from Compilation Results}
\usage{
extract_valid_grid(compiled_grid)
}
\arguments{
\item{compiled_grid}{A tibble, the result of a call to \code{compile_keras_grid()}.}
}
\value{
A tibble containing the subset of the original grid that resulted in
a successful model compilation (i.e., where the \code{error} column is \code{NA}).
The columns for \code{compiled_model}, \code{model_summary}, and \code{error} are removed.
}
\description{
This helper function filters the results from \code{compile_keras_grid()} to
return a new hyperparameter grid containing only the combinations that
compiled successfully.
