\title{Extract Valid Grid from Compilation Results}
\usage{
extract_valid_grid(compiled_grid)
}
\arguments{
\item{compiled_grid}{A tibble, the result of a call to \code{compile_keras_grid()}.}
}
\value{
A tibble containing the subset of the original grid that resulted in
a successful model compilation. The \code{compiled_model} and \code{error} columns
are removed, leaving a clean grid ready for tuning.
}
\description{
This helper function filters the results from \code{compile_keras_grid()} to
return a new hyperparameter grid containing only the combinations that
compiled successfully.
}
\details{
Filter a Grid to Only Valid Hyperparameter Sets

After running \code{compile_keras_grid()}, you can use this function to remove
problematic hyperparameter combinations before proceeding to the full
\code{tune::tune_grid()}.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Continuing the example from `compile_keras_grid`:

# `compiled_grid` contains one row with an error.
valid_grid <- extract_valid_grid(compiled_grid)

# `valid_grid` now only contains the rows that compiled successfully.
print(valid_grid)

# This clean grid can now be passed to tune::tune_grid().
}
