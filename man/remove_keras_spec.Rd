\title{Remove a Keras Model Specification}
\usage{
remove_keras_spec(model_name, env = parent.frame())
}
\arguments{
\item{model_name}{A character string giving the name of the model
specification function to remove.}

\item{env}{The environment from which to remove the function. Defaults to
the calling environment (\code{parent.frame()}), which is typically where
\code{create_keras_sequential_spec()} would have created the function.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{TRUE} if the function was found and removed,
and \code{FALSE} otherwise.
}
\description{
This function removes a model specification function that was previously
created by \code{create_keras_sequential_spec()} from an environment.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# First, create a dummy spec
dense_block <- function(model, units = 16) {
  model |> keras3::layer_dense(units = units)
}
create_keras_sequential_spec("my_temp_model", list(dense = dense_block), "regression")

# Check it exists
exists("my_temp_model")

# Now remove it
remove_keras_spec("my_temp_model")

# Check it's gone
!exists("my_temp_model")
}
}
